# 🌉 Bridge the Gap

**Bridge the Gap** is a web-based platform that connects **wedding venues** and **NGOs** to **redistribute leftover food** responsibly. Our goal is to reduce food waste by bridging the communication gap between food sources (venues) and distributors (NGOs or individuals).

## 💡 Thought Behind the Project
